"Design a responsive, futuristic, and professional website for a modern tech company named Airavata Technologies. The theme should be clean and minimalistic, with a primary white color palette, complemented by light shades of silver, blue, and soft neon accents for highlights. Use modern UI/UX design practices, smooth scroll-triggered animations, micro-interactions, and glassmorphism or neumorphism elements subtly.

The website should include the following pages and sections:

1. Home Page
Hero section with animated background (particles, gradient waves, or floating tech icons)

Tagline: "Innovating Tomorrow, Today"

Call-to-Action button ("Explore Services", "Get in Touch")

Smooth scroll or parallax effect

Animated statistics counter (clients, projects, years of experience)

Preview of services and project highlights with subtle hover animations

2. About Us
Company introduction with a brief timeline animation

Vision and Mission cards with hover effects

Meet the Team: Animated cards or hover-reveal bios

Floating avatar or AI-style illustrations
